# Chernoff Faces For Process Model Quality

[Chernoff faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face) are a whimsical data visualization technique invented by Hermann Chernoff, exploiting the ability of human brains to recognize small differences in facial features easily. 

This simple library uses matplotlib and adapts an earlier version by [Abraham Flaxman](https://gist.github.com/aflaxman/4043086) ([@aflaxman](https://gist.github.com/aflaxman)). As well as the traditional 18 variables, it adds hair.

I first learned of this technique from the novel _Blindsight_, by Peter Watts, which is excellent, and everyone should go and read.

# Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(I use a venv)


# Example Use


```
    vec[EYE_SIZE] = precision
    vec[EYEBROW_SLANT] = 1-simplicity
    ax = fig.add_subplot(5,5,1+offset,aspect='equal')
    cface(ax, *vec)
```

See [`pmqfaces.py`](src/pmqfaces.py) for a full working example.
